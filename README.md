## About

The main goal of Lucia is to help you get a head start to make your next beautiful Chrome extension. Currently, the word “Framework” is a bit misleading. At the current state, Lucia is more likely a start template where you can start your next project in seconds. Lucia comes with webpack preconfigured TailwindCSS, AlpineJS CSP and jQuery.

### Prerequirements

You only need a `NPM (Node Power Man)` installed and a cup of coffee. (Second is optional but highly recommended)

### Installation

_Normally, to get all this into an extension takes some time due to the policies of Google and the nature of module-based JavaScript. However, getting to begin with Lucia is simple as walking through a park in the summer. (or winter if you prefer it more)_

1. Clone the repo at any place on your local machine
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/3AGLExyz/Lucia-Chrome-Extension-Framework
   ```
2. Install `NPM packages`, build `JS (Webpack)` & `CSS`
   ```sh
   npm run lucia-install
   ```
3. Load the `extension` folder as an `Unpacked Extension` 
   ```js
   chrome://extensions/
   ```
